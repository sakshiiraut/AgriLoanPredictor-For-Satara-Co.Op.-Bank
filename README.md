🌾 AgriLoanPredictor - Loan Prediction for Farmers
Project Overview
AgriLoanPredictor is a machine learning-powered web application built using Streamlit that predicts the sanctioned loan amount for farmers based on agricultural and financial parameters.
This project was developed for the Satara District Central Co-operative Bank between January 2025 – March 2025 as part of the PCCOE curriculum.

The tool supports faster and more data-driven decision-making for agricultural loan approvals.
